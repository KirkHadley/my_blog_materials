Title: Hello World!

Welcome to the new blog from [Pisgah Analytics](http://www.pisgahanalytics.com), Training Problems.The name comes in part, obviously, from the use of training sets to "teach" machine learning models and secondly from frustration over seeing "data science tutorials" that showed readers how to "import sklearn," but not much else. Indeed, despite the hype, there is a lack of readily available content describing how to effectively approach non-trivial real world data science problems. TP will fill this void.

Things here will be markedly different from the typical data science lite articles. TP will cover every aspect of the data science development cycle- data source identification, data collection, model implementation, model training, and, finally, deployment & visualization. Supplementing these tutorial-style pieces will be thoroughly biased remarks on tooling and workflows, as well as significantly less biased comparisons of common machine learning frameworks.

A note on implementation: not invented here syndrome is an unfortunately common bias in software engineering and should indeed be avoided. However, this is not an excuse for relying, and thereby not fully understanding, exclusively on 3rd party implementations. To arrrive at a happy medium between these two extremes, a common pattern here will to implement a barebones version of a given model one week for understanding, then use an existing third party library in "production".

This is data science in the wild.

Things will kick off next week with the first installment of an in-depth look at [prediction markets](https://www.predictit.org/), with an eye toward developing a model for outsmarting the crowd.
